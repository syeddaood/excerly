# DawnLock Architecture

## Monorepo layout (issue #17 foundation)

```
dawnlock/
├── apps/
│   ├── mobile/          # Expo (React Native) client — iOS + Android
│   └── api/             # Next.js App Router backend
├── packages/
│   └── shared/          # Shared TypeScript types + pure utilities
├── package.json         # npm workspaces root
├── tsconfig.base.json   # Shared TS compiler defaults
└── ARCHITECTURE.md
```

## Workspaces

| Package            | Name               | Role                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `apps/mobile`      | `@dawnlock/mobile` | Expo app; consumes `@dawnlock/shared`     |
| `apps/api`         | `@dawnlock/api`    | Next.js API + health smoke route          |
| `packages/shared`  | `@dawnlock/shared` | Types (`Alarm`, `Mission`) + pure helpers |

Root `package.json` uses **npm workspaces** (`apps/*`, `packages/*`). Node ≥ 20.

## Conventions

- **Language:** TypeScript strict (`tsconfig.base.json`).
- **Shared code:** Only pure types/utilities in `packages/shared`. No React Native or Next imports there.
- **API:** App Router under `apps/api/src/app`. Health smoke: `GET /api/health`.
- **Mobile:** Expo entry via `apps/mobile/index.js` → `App.tsx`. Feature screens land in later issues.
- **No feature work here:** Alarm scheduling, missions, auth, payments, etc. belong to later backlog items (R1–R42). This scaffold is intentionally a vertical smoke slice only.

## Smoke verification

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck -w @dawnlock/shared
npm run test -w @dawnlock/shared
npm run typecheck -w @dawnlock/api
npm run typecheck -w @dawnlock/mobile
```

## Product context (from README)

DawnLock is a cross-platform alarm-accountability app: alarms dismiss only after a completed mission (photo object, math, steps, …). This document describes **repo structure only**; product requirements live in the README and later issues.
